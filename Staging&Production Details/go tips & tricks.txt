Data Serialization :
 1.use "encoding/gob"(go binary) for golang only services, supports all golang types.
 2.use "encoding/json"(javascript object notation) for communication over different languages.
 3.use gzip to compress the bytes.

Goroutines:
 1.use them for i/o operations
 2.use channels for communication over different goroutines
 3.use sync.waitgroup instead of channels if no communication
 4.use sync.mutex to lock & unlock resources to prevent race conditions
 5.close channel in the same func in which its opened else use defer in go func
