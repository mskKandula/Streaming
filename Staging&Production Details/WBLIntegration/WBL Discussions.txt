Discuss the case of 'Keep source profile active' with Deepti Ma'am- 
1. What if the interns are transferred to next semester & 
then we decide to keep the source profile active?
(Need new form/page)

2. The interns those are 'All clear' in 1st semester & are 
transferred to 2nd semester should also be able to see the 
data (learning, assignments, etc.) from previous semester.
(Done)

3. If students transferred without the payment check, 
How does Admin know who need to pay later
(can see from student details)

Most of the activities are with just(clientId/studentId),
we get error later when student transferred to another 
standard/shift/division & also isActive, isDeleted also missing
